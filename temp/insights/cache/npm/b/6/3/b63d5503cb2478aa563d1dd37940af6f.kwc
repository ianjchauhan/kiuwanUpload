LaunchDarkly SDK for Client-Side JavaScript\n\n[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/next.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/next)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is the official LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK. This SDK does two\nthings:\n\n* Makes feature flags available to your client-side (front-end) JavaScript code.\n* Sends click, pageview, and custom events from your front-end for A/B tests and\n  analytics.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThe LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK supports the following browsers:\n\n* Chrome (any recent)\n* Firefox (any recent)\n* Safari (any recent)\\*\n* Internet Explorer (IE10+)\\*\n* Edge (any recent)\\*\n* Opera (any recent)\\*\n\n\\* These browsers do not support streaming new flags to connected clients, even\nwhen `client.on('change')` is called.\n\n### EventSource polyfill\n\nIf you need streaming support, and you wish to support browsers that do not\nsupport `EventSource` natively, you can install a polyfill, such as\n[EventSource](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource).\n\nYou can load the polyfill via a script tag in the `<head>` before the script\nwhere you initialize `LDClient`:\n\n    <script src=\"/public/eventsource.js\"></script>\n\nIf you use [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) or\n[browserify](http://browserify.org/), make sure to require the polyfill before\n`LDClient` is initialized.\n\n### Document.querySelectorAll() polyfill\n\nIf you need to run A/B tests on IE7 or IE8 you will need to install a polyfill\nfor `document.querySelector()` such as\n[polyfill-queryselector](https://github.com/cobbdb/polyfill-queryselector).\n\nYou can load the polyfll via a script tag in the `<head>`:\n\n    <script src=\"/public/querySelector.js\"></script>\n\nYou can also install it with `npm install polyfill-queryselector` or `bower install polyfill-queryselector`.\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are two ways to install the client-side SDK:\n\n1. Via the `npm` package: `npm install --save ldclient-js`\n\n2. A minimized version of the script is also hosted on our CDN, and can be\n   included via a `script` tag:\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://app.launchdarkly.com/snippet/ldclient.min.js\">\n```\n\n## Basics\n\nTo create a client instance, pass your environment's client-side ID (available\non your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)) and\nuser context to the `LDClient.initialize` function:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);\n```\n\n## Feature flags\n\nThe client will emit a `ready` event when it has been initialized. Once it has\nbeen initialized, call `variation` to access your feature flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('ready', function() {\n console.log(\"It's now safe to request feature flags\");\n var showFeature = client.variation(\"YOUR_FEATURE_KEY\", false);\n\n if (showFeature) {\n   ...\n } else {\n   ...\n }\n  });\n```\n\nOut of the box, initializing the client will make a remote request to\nLaunchDarkly, so it may take approximately 100 milliseconds before the ready\nevent is emitted. If you require feature flag values before rendering the page,\nwe recommend bootstrapping the client. If the client is bootstrapped, it will\nemit the ready event immediately.\n\n_Note_: Feature flags must marked available to the client-side SDK (see your\nfeature flag's settings page) before they can be used in variation calls on the\nfront-end. If you request a feature flag that is not available, you'll receive\nthe default value for that flag.\n\nYou can also fetch all feature flags for a user:\n\n```js\nvar flags = client.allFlags();\n```\n\nThis will return a key / value map of all your feature flags. The map will\ncontain `null` values for any flags that would return the fallback value (the\nsecond argument that you normally pass to `variation`). Note that this will send\nanalytics events to LaunchDarkly as if you'd called `variation` for every\nfeature flag.\n\n### Bootstrapping\n\nBootstrapping refers to providing the LaunchDarkly client object with an\ninitial, immediately available set of feature flag values so that on page load\n`variation` can be called with no delay.\n\n#### From the server-side SDK\n\nThe preferred approach to bootstrapping is to populate the bootstrap values (a\nmap of feature flag keys to flag values) from your backend. LaunchDarkly's\nserver-side SDKs have a function called `allFlags`-- this function provides the\ninitial set of bootstrap values. You can then provide these values to your\nfront-end as a template. Depending on your templating language, this might look\nsomething like this:\n\n```js\nvar user = {key: 'user.example.com'};\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n bootstrap: {\n   {{ ldclient.all_flags(user) }}\n }\n});\n```\n\nIf you bootstrap from the server-side, feature flags will be ready immediately,\nand clients will always receive the latest feature flag values.\n\n#### From Local Storage\n\nAlternatively, you can bootstrap feature flags from local storage.\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    bootstrap: 'localStorage',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nWhen using local storage, the client will store the latest flag settings in\nlocal storage. On page load, the previous settings will be used and the 'ready'\nevent will be emitted immediately. This means that on page load, the user may\nsee cached flag values until the next page load.\n\nYou can still subscribe to flag changes if you're using local storage.\n\n### Secure mode\n\nSecure mode ensures that feature flag settings for a user are kept private, and\nthat one user cannot inspect the settings for another user. Secure mode works by\nhaving you include a server-generated HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, signed\nwith the SDK key for your environment.\n\nYou can enable secure mode for each environment on your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). You\nshould send the computed hash for your user in the `options` array during client\ninitialization:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    hash: 'SERVER_GENERATED_HASH',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nEach of our server-side SDKs includes a method to compute the secure mode hash\nfor a user. You can pass this to your front-end code in a template. For example:\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n       hash: {{ ldclient.secure_mode_hash(user) }} // this is a template directive, and the ldclient instance here is your server-side SDK client\n  });\n```\n\nTo compute the hash yourself, locate the SDK key for your environment on your\naccount settings page. Then, compute an HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, using\nyour SDK key as a secret. Here's what this would look like in Node.js:\n\n```js\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_SDK_KEY');\nhmac.update('YOUR_USER_KEY');\nhash = hmac.digest('hex');\n```\n\n### Listening to flag change events\n\nThe client uses an event emitter pattern to allow you to subscribe to feature\nflag changes in real time. To subscribe to all feature flag changes, listen for\nthe `change` event:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change', function(settings) {\n  console.log('flags changed:', settings);\n});\n```\n\nThe `settings` object will contain a map of updated feature flag keys and\nvalues. The map will only contain the keys to flags that have changed. You can\nalso subscribe to specific flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change:YOUR_FLAG_KEY', function(value, previous) {\n  console.log('YOUR_FLAG_KEY changed:', value, '(' + previous + ')');\n});\n```\n\n## Events\n\n### Click and pageview events\n\nIf you've defined\n[click or pageview goals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/running-ab-tests)\nin LaunchDarkly, they'll be sent automatically once the client has been\ninitialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click\nor pageview goals.\n\n### Custom events\n\nYou can send custom events by calling the client's `track` method. For example:\n\n```js\nclient.track('Signed up');\n```\n\n### Single page apps\n\nThe SDK automatically handles URL changes (made via the HTML5 history API or by\nchanging the URL hash fragment), and will trigger pageview and click events\ncorrectly.\n\n## Changing the user context\n\nYou may wish to change the user context dynamically and receive the new set of\nfeature flags for that user or generate events for the new user. For example, on\na sign-in page in a single-page app, you may initialize the client with an\nanonymous user. When the user logs in, you'd want the feature flag settings for\nthe authenticated user. To do this, you can call the `identify` function:\n\n```js\nclient.identify(newUser, hash, function() {\n  console.log(\"New user's flags available\");\n});\n```\n\nThe `hash` parameter is the hash for the new user, assuming that the user's key\nhas changed. It is only required in secure mode-- if secure mode is not enabled,\nyou can pass in `null` for the hash.\n\n## Development information\n\nTo build the module, first run `npm install`. Then run `npm run build`.

LaunchDarkly SDK for Client-Side JavaScript\n\n[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/next.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/next)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is the official LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK. This SDK does two\nthings:\n\n* Makes feature flags available to your client-side (front-end) JavaScript code.\n* Sends click, pageview, and custom events from your front-end for A/B tests and\n  analytics.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThe LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK supports the following browsers:\n\n* Chrome (any recent)\n* Firefox (any recent)\n* Safari (any recent)\\*\n* Internet Explorer (IE10+)\\*\n* Edge (any recent)\\*\n* Opera (any recent)\\*\n\n\\* These browsers do not support streaming new flags to connected clients, even\nwhen `client.on('change')` is called.\n\n### EventSource polyfill\n\nIf you need streaming support, and you wish to support browsers that do not\nsupport `EventSource` natively, you can install a polyfill, such as\n[EventSource](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource).\n\nYou can load the polyfill via a script tag in the `<head>` before the script\nwhere you initialize `LDClient`:\n\n    <script src=\"/public/eventsource.js\"></script>\n\nIf you use [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) or\n[browserify](http://browserify.org/), make sure to require the polyfill before\n`LDClient` is initialized.\n\n### Document.querySelectorAll() polyfill\n\nIf you need to run A/B tests on IE7 or IE8 you will need to install a polyfill\nfor `document.querySelector()` such as\n[polyfill-queryselector](https://github.com/cobbdb/polyfill-queryselector).\n\nYou can load the polyfll via a script tag in the `<head>`:\n\n    <script src=\"/public/querySelector.js\"></script>\n\nYou can also install it with `npm install polyfill-queryselector` or `bower install polyfill-queryselector`.\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are two ways to install the client-side SDK:\n\n1. Via the `npm` package: `npm install --save ldclient-js`\n\n2. A minimized version of the script is also hosted on our CDN, and can be\n   included via a `script` tag:\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://app.launchdarkly.com/snippet/ldclient.min.js\">\n```\n\n## Basics\n\nTo create a client instance, pass your environment's client-side ID (available\non your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)) and\nuser context to the `LDClient.initialize` function:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);\n```\n\n## Feature flags\n\nThe client will emit a `ready` event when it has been initialized. Once it has\nbeen initialized, call `variation` to access your feature flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('ready', function() {\n console.log(\"It's now safe to request feature flags\");\n var showFeature = client.variation(\"YOUR_FEATURE_KEY\", false);\n\n if (showFeature) {\n   ...\n } else {\n   ...\n }\n  });\n```\n\nOut of the box, initializing the client will make a remote request to\nLaunchDarkly, so it may take approximately 100 milliseconds before the ready\nevent is emitted. If you require feature flag values before rendering the page,\nwe recommend bootstrapping the client. If the client is bootstrapped, it will\nemit the ready event immediately.\n\n_Note_: Feature flags must marked available to the client-side SDK (see your\nfeature flag's settings page) before they can be used in variation calls on the\nfront-end. If you request a feature flag that is not available, you'll receive\nthe default value for that flag.\n\nYou can also fetch all feature flags for a user:\n\n```js\nvar flags = client.allFlags();\n```\n\nThis will return a key / value map of all your feature flags. The map will\ncontain `null` values for any flags that would return the fallback value (the\nsecond argument that you normally pass to `variation`). Note that this will send\nanalytics events to LaunchDarkly as if you'd called `variation` for every\nfeature flag.\n\n### Bootstrapping\n\nBootstrapping refers to providing the LaunchDarkly client object with an\ninitial, immediately available set of feature flag values so that on page load\n`variation` can be called with no delay.\n\n#### From the server-side SDK\n\nThe preferred approach to bootstrapping is to populate the bootstrap values (a\nmap of feature flag keys to flag values) from your backend. LaunchDarkly's\nserver-side SDKs have a function called `allFlags`-- this function provides the\ninitial set of bootstrap values. You can then provide these values to your\nfront-end as a template. Depending on your templating language, this might look\nsomething like this:\n\n```js\nvar user = {key: 'user.example.com'};\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n bootstrap: {\n   {{ ldclient.all_flags(user) }}\n }\n});\n```\n\nIf you bootstrap from the server-side, feature flags will be ready immediately,\nand clients will always receive the latest feature flag values.\n\n#### From Local Storage\n\nAlternatively, you can bootstrap feature flags from local storage.\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    bootstrap: 'localStorage',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nWhen using local storage, the client will store the latest flag settings in\nlocal storage. On page load, the previous settings will be used and the 'ready'\nevent will be emitted immediately. This means that on page load, the user may\nsee cached flag values until the next page load.\n\nYou can still subscribe to flag changes if you're using local storage.\n\n### Secure mode\n\nSecure mode ensures that feature flag settings for a user are kept private, and\nthat one user cannot inspect the settings for another user. Secure mode works by\nhaving you include a server-generated HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, signed\nwith the SDK key for your environment.\n\nYou can enable secure mode for each environment on your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). You\nshould send the computed hash for your user in the `options` array during client\ninitialization:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    hash: 'SERVER_GENERATED_HASH',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nEach of our server-side SDKs includes a method to compute the secure mode hash\nfor a user. You can pass this to your front-end code in a template. For example:\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n       hash: {{ ldclient.secure_mode_hash(user) }} // this is a template directive, and the ldclient instance here is your server-side SDK client\n  });\n```\n\nTo compute the hash yourself, locate the SDK key for your environment on your\naccount settings page. Then, compute an HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, using\nyour SDK key as a secret. Here's what this would look like in Node.js:\n\n```js\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_SDK_KEY');\nhmac.update('YOUR_USER_KEY');\nhash = hmac.digest('hex');\n```\n\n### Listening to flag change events\n\nThe client uses an event emitter pattern to allow you to subscribe to feature\nflag changes in real time. To subscribe to all feature flag changes, listen for\nthe `change` event:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change', function(settings) {\n  console.log('flags changed:', settings);\n});\n```\n\nThe `settings` object will contain a map of updated feature flag keys and\nvalues. The map will only contain the keys to flags that have changed. You can\nalso subscribe to specific flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change:YOUR_FLAG_KEY', function(value, previous) {\n  console.log('YOUR_FLAG_KEY changed:', value, '(' + previous + ')');\n});\n```\n\n## Events\n\n### Click and pageview events\n\nIf you've defined\n[click or pageview goals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/running-ab-tests)\nin LaunchDarkly, they'll be sent automatically once the client has been\ninitialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click\nor pageview goals.\n\n### Custom events\n\nYou can send custom events by calling the client's `track` method. For example:\n\n```js\nclient.track('Signed up');\n```\n\n### Single page apps\n\nThe SDK automatically handles URL changes (made via the HTML5 history API or by\nchanging the URL hash fragment), and will trigger pageview and click events\ncorrectly.\n\n## Changing the user context\n\nYou may wish to change the user context dynamically and receive the new set of\nfeature flags for that user or generate events for the new user. For example, on\na sign-in page in a single-page app, you may initialize the client with an\nanonymous user. When the user logs in, you'd want the feature flag settings for\nthe authenticated user. To do this, you can call the `identify` function:\n\n```js\nclient.identify(newUser, hash, function() {\n  console.log(\"New user's flags available\");\n});\n```\n\nThe `hash` parameter is the hash for the new user, assuming that the user's key\nhas changed. It is only required in secure mode-- if secure mode is not enabled,\nyou can pass in `null` for the hash.\n\n## Development information\n\nTo build the module, first run `npm install`. Then run `npm run build`. You can\nalso run `npm run watch` to rebuild the module automatically on file change.\n\nTo run the tests, run `npm run test`.\n\n## Community\n\nHere are resources from our awesome community:\n\n* [TrueCar/react-launch-darkly](https://github.com/TrueCar/react-launch-darkly/): A set of component helpers to add support for LaunchDarkly to your React.js app\n* [yusinto/ld-redux](https://github.com/yusinto/ld-redux/): A library to integrate LaunchDarkly with React and Redux\n* [tdeekens/flopflip](https://github.com/tdeekens/flopflip): A flexible feature-toggling library that integrates with LaunchDarkly\n\n## About LaunchDarkly\n\n* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely.

LaunchDarkly SDK for Client-Side JavaScript\n\n[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/next.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/next)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is the official LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK. This SDK does two\nthings:\n\n* Makes feature flags available to your client-side (front-end) JavaScript code.\n* Sends click, pageview, and custom events from your front-end for A/B tests and\n  analytics.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThe LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK supports the following browsers:\n\n* Chrome (any recent)\n* Firefox (any recent)\n* Safari (any recent)\\*\n* Internet Explorer (IE10+)\\*\n* Edge (any recent)\\*\n* Opera (any recent)\\*\n\n\\* These browsers do not support streaming new flags to connected clients, even\nwhen `client.on('change')` is called.\n\n### EventSource polyfill\n\nIf you need streaming support, and you wish to support browsers that do not\nsupport `EventSource` natively, you can install a polyfill, such as\n[EventSource](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource).\n\nYou can load the polyfill via a script tag in the `<head>` before the script\nwhere you initialize `LDClient`:\n\n    <script src=\"/public/eventsource.js\"></script>\n\nIf you use [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) or\n[browserify](http://browserify.org/), make sure to require the polyfill before\n`LDClient` is initialized.\n\n### Document.querySelectorAll() polyfill\n\nIf you need to run A/B tests on IE7 or IE8 you will need to install a polyfill\nfor `document.querySelector()` such as\n[polyfill-queryselector](https://github.com/cobbdb/polyfill-queryselector).\n\nYou can load the polyfll via a script tag in the `<head>`:\n\n    <script src=\"/public/querySelector.js\"></script>\n\nYou can also install it with `npm install polyfill-queryselector` or `bower install polyfill-queryselector`.\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are two ways to install the client-side SDK:\n\n1. Via the `npm` package: `npm install --save ldclient-js`\n\n2. A minimized version of the script is also hosted on our CDN, and can be\n   included via a `script` tag:\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://app.launchdarkly.com/snippet/ldclient.min.js\">\n```\n\n## Basics\n\nTo create a client instance, pass your environment's client-side ID (available\non your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)) and\nuser context to the `LDClient.initialize` function:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);\n```\n\n## Feature flags\n\nThe client will emit a `ready` event when it has been initialized. Once it has\nbeen initialized, call `variation` to access your feature flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('ready', function() {\n console.log(\"It's now safe to request feature flags\");\n var showFeature = client.variation(\"YOUR_FEATURE_KEY\", false);\n\n if (showFeature) {\n   ...\n } else {\n   ...\n }\n  });\n```\n\nOut of the box, initializing the client will make a remote request to\nLaunchDarkly, so it may take approximately 100 milliseconds before the ready\nevent is emitted. If you require feature flag values before rendering the page,\nwe recommend bootstrapping the client. If the client is bootstrapped, it will\nemit the ready event immediately.\n\n_Note_: Feature flags must marked available to the client-side SDK (see your\nfeature flag's settings page) before they can be used in variation calls on the\nfront-end. If you request a feature flag that is not available, you'll receive\nthe default value for that flag.\n\nYou can also fetch all feature flags for a user:\n\n```js\nvar flags = client.allFlags();\n```\n\nThis will return a key / value map of all your feature flags. The map will\ncontain `null` values for any flags that would return the fallback value (the\nsecond argument that you normally pass to `variation`). Note that this will send\nanalytics events to LaunchDarkly as if you'd called `variation` for every\nfeature flag.\n\n### Bootstrapping\n\nBootstrapping refers to providing the LaunchDarkly client object with an\ninitial, immediately available set of feature flag values so that on page load\n`variation` can be called with no delay.\n\n#### From the server-side SDK\n\nThe preferred approach to bootstrapping is to populate the bootstrap values (a\nmap of feature flag keys to flag values) from your backend. LaunchDarkly's\nserver-side SDKs have a function called `allFlags`-- this function provides the\ninitial set of bootstrap values. You can then provide these values to your\nfront-end as a template. Depending on your templating language, this might look\nsomething like this:\n\n```js\nvar user = {key: 'user.example.com'};\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n bootstrap: {\n   {{ ldclient.all_flags(user) }}\n }\n});\n```\n\nIf you bootstrap from the server-side, feature flags will be ready immediately,\nand clients will always receive the latest feature flag values.\n\n#### From Local Storage\n\nAlternatively, you can bootstrap feature flags from local storage.\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    bootstrap: 'localStorage',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nWhen using local storage, the client will store the latest flag settings in\nlocal storage. On page load, the previous settings will be used and the 'ready'\nevent will be emitted immediately. This means that on page load, the user may\nsee cached flag values until the next page load.\n\nYou can still subscribe to flag changes if you're using local storage.\n\n### Secure mode\n\nSecure mode ensures that feature flag settings for a user are kept private, and\nthat one user cannot inspect the settings for another user. Secure mode works by\nhaving you include a server-generated HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, signed\nwith the SDK key for your environment.\n\nYou can enable secure mode for each environment on your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). You\nshould send the computed hash for your user in the `options` array during client\ninitialization:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    hash: 'SERVER_GENERATED_HASH',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nEach of our server-side SDKs includes a method to compute the secure mode hash\nfor a user. You can pass this to your front-end code in a template. For example:\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n       hash: {{ ldclient.secure_mode_hash(user) }} // this is a template directive, and the ldclient instance here is your server-side SDK client\n  });\n```\n\nTo compute the hash yourself, locate the SDK key for your environment on your\naccount settings page. Then, compute an HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, using\nyour SDK key as a secret. Here's what this would look like in Node.js:\n\n```js\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_SDK_KEY');\nhmac.update('YOUR_USER_KEY');\nhash = hmac.digest('hex');\n```\n\n### Listening to flag change events\n\nThe client uses an event emitter pattern to allow you to subscribe to feature\nflag changes in real time. To subscribe to all feature flag changes, listen for\nthe `change` event:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change', function(settings) {\n  console.log('flags changed:', settings);\n});\n```\n\nThe `settings` object will contain a map of updated feature flag keys and\nvalues. The map will only contain the keys to flags that have changed. You can\nalso subscribe to specific flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change:YOUR_FLAG_KEY', function(value, previous) {\n  console.log('YOUR_FLAG_KEY changed:', value, '(' + previous + ')');\n});\n```\n\n## Events\n\n### Click and pageview events\n\nIf you've defined\n[click or pageview goals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/running-ab-tests)\nin LaunchDarkly, they'll be sent automatically once the client has been\ninitialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click\nor pageview goals.\n\n### Custom events\n\nYou can send custom events by calling the client's `track` method. For example:\n\n```js\nclient.track('Signed up');\n```\n\n### Single page apps\n\nThe SDK automatically handles URL changes (made via the HTML5 history API or by\nchanging the URL hash fragment), and will trigger pageview and click events\ncorrectly.\n\n## Changing the user context\n\nYou may wish to change the user context dynamically and receive the new set of\nfeature flags for that user or generate events for the new user. For example, on\na sign-in page in a single-page app, you may initialize the client with an\nanonymous user. When the user logs in, you'd want the feature flag settings for\nthe authenticated user. To do this, you can call the `identify` function:\n\n```js\nclient.identify(newUser, hash, function() {\n  console.log(\"New user's flags available\");\n});\n```\n\nThe `hash` parameter is the hash for the new user, assuming that the user's key\nhas changed. It is only required in secure mode-- if secure mode is not enabled,\nyou can pass in `null` for the hash.\n\n## Development information\n\nTo build the module, first run `npm install`. Then run `npm run build`. You can\nalso run `npm run watch` to rebuild the module automatically on file change.\n\nTo run the tests, run `npm run test`.\n\n## Community\n\nHere are resources from our awesome community:\n\n* [TrueCar/react-launch-darkly](https://github.com/TrueCar/react-launch-darkly/): A set of component helpers to add support for LaunchDarkly to your React.js app\n* [yusinto/ld-redux](https://github.com/yusinto/ld-redux/): A library to integrate LaunchDarkly with React and Redux\n* [tdeekens/flopflip](https://github.com/tdeekens/flopflip): A flexible feature-toggling library that integrates with LaunchDarkly\n\n## About LaunchDarkly\n\n* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard. With LaunchDarkly, you can:\n  * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.\n  * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).\n  * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.\n  * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the gold plan get access to more features than users in the silver plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.\n* LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for\n  *

LaunchDarkly's\nserver-side SDKs have a function called `allFlags`-- this function provides the\ninitial set of bootstrap values. You can then provide these values to your\nfront-end as a template. Depending on your templating language, this might look\nsomething like this:\n\n```js\nvar user = {key: 'user.example.com'};\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n bootstrap: {\n   {{ ldclient.all_flags(user) }}\n }\n});\n```\n\nIf you bootstrap from the server-side, feature flags will be ready immediately,\nand clients will always receive the latest feature flag values.\n\n#### From Local Storage\n\nAlternatively, you can bootstrap feature flags from local storage.\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    bootstrap: 'localStorage',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nWhen using local storage, the client will store the latest flag settings in\nlocal storage. On page load, the previous settings will be used and the 'ready'\nevent will be emitted immediately. This means that on page load, the user may\nsee cached flag values until the next page load.\n\nYou can still subscribe to flag changes if you're using local storage.\n\n### Secure mode\n\nSecure mode ensures that feature flag settings for a user are kept private, and\nthat one user cannot inspect the settings for another user. Secure mode works by\nhaving you include a server-generated HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, signed\nwith the SDK key for your environment.\n\nYou can enable secure mode for each environment on your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). You\nshould send the computed hash for your user in the `options` array during client\ninitialization:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    hash: 'SERVER_GENERATED_HASH',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nEach of our server-side SDKs includes a method to compute the secure mode hash\nfor a user. You can pass this to your front-end code in a template. For example:\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n       hash: {{ ldclient.secure_mode_hash(user) }} // this is a template directive, and the ldclient instance here is your server-side SDK client\n  });\n```\n\nTo compute the hash yourself, locate the SDK key for your environment on your\naccount settings page. Then, compute an HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, using\nyour SDK key as a secret. Here's what this would look like in Node.js:\n\n```js\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_SDK_KEY');\nhmac.update('YOUR_USER_KEY');\nhash = hmac.digest('hex');\n```\n\n### Listening to flag change events\n\nThe client uses an event emitter pattern to allow you to subscribe to feature\nflag changes in real time. To subscribe to all feature flag changes, listen for\nthe `change` event:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change', function(settings) {\n  console.log('flags changed:', settings);\n});\n```\n\nThe `settings` object will contain a map of updated feature flag keys and\nvalues. The map will only contain the keys to flags that have changed. You can\nalso subscribe to specific flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change:YOUR_FLAG_KEY', function(value, previous) {\n  console.log('YOUR_FLAG_KEY changed:', value, '(' + previous + ')');\n});\n```\n\n## Events\n\n### Click and pageview events\n\nIf you've defined\n[click or pageview goals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/running-ab-tests)\nin LaunchDarkly, they'll be sent automatically once the client has been\ninitialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click\nor pageview goals.\n\n### Custom events\n\nYou can send custom events by calling the client's `track` method. For example:\n\n```js\nclient.track('Signed up');\n```\n\n### Single page apps\n\nThe SDK automatically handles URL changes (made via the HTML5 history API or by\nchanging the URL hash fragment), and will trigger pageview and click events\ncorrectly.\n\n## Changing the user context\n\nYou may wish to change the user context dynamically and receive the new set of\nfeature flags for that user or generate events for the new user. For example, on\na sign-in page in a single-page app, you may initialize the client with an\nanonymous user. When the user logs in, you'd want the feature flag settings for\nthe authenticated user. To do this, you can call the `identify` function:\n\n```js\nclient.identify(newUser, hash, function() {\n  console.log(\"New user's flags available\");\n});\n```\n\nThe `hash` parameter is the hash for the new user, assuming that the user's key\nhas changed. It is only required in secure mode-- if secure mode is not enabled,\nyou can pass in `null` for the hash.\n\n## Development information\n\nTo build the module, first run `npm install`. Then run `npm run build`. You can\nalso run `npm run watch` to rebuild the module automatically on file change.\n\nTo run the tests, run `npm run test`.\n\n## Community\n\nHere are resources from our awesome community:\n\n* [TrueCar/react-launch-darkly](https://github.com/TrueCar/react-launch-darkly/): A set of component helpers to add support for LaunchDarkly to your React.js app\n* [yusinto/ld-redux](https://github.com/yusinto/ld-redux/): A library to integrate LaunchDarkly with React and Redux\n* [tdeekens/flopflip](https://github.com/tdeekens/flopflip): A flexible feature-toggling library that integrates with LaunchDarkly\n\n## About LaunchDarkly\n\n* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely.

LaunchDarkly SDK for Client-Side JavaScript\n\n[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/next.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/next)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is the official LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK. This SDK does two\nthings:\n\n* Makes feature flags available to your client-side (front-end) JavaScript code.\n* Sends click, pageview, and custom events from your front-end for A/B tests and\n  analytics.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThe LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK supports the following browsers:\n\n* Chrome (any recent)\n* Firefox (any recent)\n* Safari (any recent)\\*\n* Internet Explorer (IE10+)\\*\n* Edge (any recent)\\*\n* Opera (any recent)\\*\n\n\\* These browsers do not support streaming new flags to connected clients, even\nwhen `client.on('change')` is called.\n\n### EventSource polyfill\n\nIf you need streaming support, and you wish to support browsers that do not\nsupport `EventSource` natively, you can install a polyfill, such as\n[EventSource](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource).\n\nYou can load the polyfill via a script tag in the `<head>` before the script\nwhere you initialize `LDClient`:\n\n    <script src=\"/public/eventsource.js\"></script>\n\nIf you use [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) or\n[browserify](http://browserify.org/), make sure to require the polyfill before\n`LDClient` is initialized.\n\n### Document.querySelectorAll() polyfill\n\nIf you need to run A/B tests on IE7 or IE8 you will need to install a polyfill\nfor `document.querySelector()` such as\n[polyfill-queryselector](https://github.com/cobbdb/polyfill-queryselector).\n\nYou can load the polyfll via a script tag in the `<head>`:\n\n    <script src=\"/public/querySelector.js\"></script>\n\nYou can also install it with `npm install polyfill-queryselector` or `bower install polyfill-queryselector`.\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are two ways to install the client-side SDK:\n\n1. Via the `npm` package: `npm install --save ldclient-js`\n\n2. A minimized version of the script is also hosted on our CDN, and can be\n   included via a `script` tag:\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://app.launchdarkly.com/snippet/ldclient.min.js\">\n```\n\n## Basics\n\nTo create a client instance, pass your environment's client-side ID (available\non your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)) and\nuser context to the `LDClient.initialize` function:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);\n```\n\n## Feature flags\n\nThe client will emit a `ready` event when it has been initialized. Once it has\nbeen initialized, call `variation` to access your feature flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('ready', function() {\n console.log(\"It's now safe to request feature flags\");\n var showFeature = client.variation(\"YOUR_FEATURE_KEY\", false);\n\n if (showFeature) {\n   ...\n } else {\n   ...\n }\n  });\n```\n\nOut of the box, initializing the client will make a remote request to\nLaunchDarkly, so it may take approximately 100 milliseconds before the ready\nevent is emitted. If you require feature flag values before rendering the page,\nwe recommend bootstrapping the client. If the client is bootstrapped, it will\nemit the ready event immediately.\n\n_Note_: Feature flags must marked available to the client-side SDK (see your\nfeature flag's settings page) before they can be used in variation calls on the\nfront-end. If you request a feature flag that is not available, you'll receive\nthe default value for that flag.\n\nYou can also fetch all feature flags for a user:\n\n```js\nvar flags = client.allFlags();\n```\n\nThis will return a key / value map of all your feature flags. The map will\ncontain `null` values for any flags that would return the fallback value (the\nsecond argument that you normally pass to `variation`). Note that this will send\nanalytics events to LaunchDarkly as if you'd called `variation` for every\nfeature flag.\n\n### Bootstrapping\n\nBootstrapping refers to providing the LaunchDarkly client object with an\ninitial, immediately available set of feature flag values so that on page load\n`variation` can be called with no delay.\n\n#### From the server-side SDK\n\nThe preferred approach to bootstrapping is to populate the bootstrap values (a\nmap of feature flag keys to flag values) from your backend. LaunchDarkly's\nserver-side SDKs have a function called `allFlags`-- this function provides the\ninitial set of bootstrap values. You can then provide these values to your\nfront-end as a template. Depending on your templating language, this might look\nsomething like this:\n\n```js\nvar user = {key: 'user.example.com'};\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n bootstrap: {\n   {{ ldclient.all_flags(user) }}\n }\n});\n```\n\nIf you bootstrap from the server-side, feature flags will be ready immediately,\nand clients will always receive the latest feature flag values.\n\n#### From Local Storage\n\nAlternatively, you can bootstrap feature flags from local storage.\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    bootstrap: 'localStorage',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nWhen using local storage, the client will store the latest flag settings in\nlocal storage. On page load, the previous settings will be used and the 'ready'\nevent will be emitted immediately. This means that on page load, the user may\nsee cached flag values until the next page load.\n\nYou can still subscribe to flag changes if you're using local storage.\n\n### Secure mode\n\nSecure mode ensures that feature flag settings for a user are kept private, and\nthat one user cannot inspect the settings for another user. Secure mode works by\nhaving you include a server-generated HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, signed\nwith the SDK key for your environment.\n\nYou can enable secure mode for each environment on your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). You\nshould send the computed hash for your user in the `options` array during client\ninitialization:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    hash: 'SERVER_GENERATED_HASH',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nEach of our server-side SDKs includes a method to compute the secure mode hash\nfor a user. You can pass this to your front-end code in a template. For example:\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n       hash: {{ ldclient.secure_mode_hash(user) }} // this is a template directive, and the ldclient instance here is your server-side SDK client\n  });\n```\n\nTo compute the hash yourself, locate the SDK key for your environment on your\naccount settings page. Then, compute an HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, using\nyour SDK key as a secret. Here's what this would look like in Node.js:\n\n```js\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_SDK_KEY');\nhmac.update('YOUR_USER_KEY');\nhash = hmac.digest('hex');\n```\n\n### Listening to flag change events\n\nThe client uses an event emitter pattern to allow you to subscribe to feature\nflag changes in real time. To subscribe to all feature flag changes, listen for\nthe `change` event:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change', function(settings) {\n  console.log('flags changed:', settings);\n});\n```\n\nThe `settings` object will contain a map of updated feature flag keys and\nvalues. The map will only contain the keys to flags that have changed. You can\nalso subscribe to specific flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change:YOUR_FLAG_KEY', function(value, previous) {\n  console.log('YOUR_FLAG_KEY changed:', value, '(' + previous + ')');\n});\n```\n\n## Events\n\n### Click and pageview events\n\nIf you've defined\n[click or pageview goals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/running-ab-tests)\nin LaunchDarkly, they'll be sent automatically once the client has been\ninitialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click\nor pageview goals.\n\n### Custom events\n\nYou can send custom events by calling the client's `track` method. For example:\n\n```js\nclient.track('Signed up');\n```\n\n### Single page apps\n\nThe SDK automatically handles URL changes (made via the HTML5 history API or by\nchanging the URL hash fragment), and will trigger pageview and click events\ncorrectly.\n\n## Changing the user context\n\nYou may wish to change the user context dynamically and receive the new set of\nfeature flags for that user or generate events for the new user. For example, on\na sign-in page in a single-page app, you may initialize the client with an\nanonymous user. When the user logs in, you'd want the feature flag settings for\nthe authenticated user. To do this, you can call the `identify` function:\n\n```js\nclient.identify(newUser, hash, function() {\n  console.log(\"New user's flags available\");\n});\n```\n\nThe `hash` parameter is the hash for the new user, assuming that the user's key\nhas changed. It is only required in secure mode-- if secure mode is not enabled,\nyou can pass in `null` for the hash.\n\n## Development information\n\nTo build the module, first run `npm install`. Then run `npm run build`. You can\nalso run `npm run watch` to rebuild the module automatically on file change.\n\nTo run the tests, run `npm run test`.\n\n## Community\n\nHere are resources from our awesome community:\n\n* [TrueCar/react-launch-darkly](https://github.com/TrueCar/react-launch-darkly/): A set of component helpers to add support for LaunchDarkly to your React.js app\n* [yusinto/ld-redux](https://github.com/yusinto/ld-redux/): A library to integrate LaunchDarkly with React and Redux\n* [tdeekens/flopflip](https://github.com/tdeekens/flopflip): A flexible feature-toggling library that integrates with LaunchDarkly\n\n## About LaunchDarkly\n\n* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely.

LaunchDarkly SDK for Client-Side JavaScript\n\n[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/next.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/next)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is the official LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK. This SDK does two\nthings:\n\n* Makes feature flags available to your client-side (front-end) JavaScript code.\n* Sends click, pageview, and custom events from your front-end for A/B tests and\n  analytics.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThe LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK supports the following browsers:\n\n* Chrome (any recent)\n* Firefox (any recent)\n* Safari (any recent)\\*\n* Internet Explorer (IE10+)\\*\n* Edge (any recent)\\*\n* Opera (any recent)\\*\n\n\\* These browsers do not support streaming new flags to connected clients, even\nwhen `client.on('change')` is called.\n\n### EventSource polyfill\n\nIf you need streaming support, and you wish to support browsers that do not\nsupport `EventSource` natively, you can install a polyfill, such as\n[EventSource](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource).\n\nYou can load the polyfill via a script tag in the `<head>` before the script\nwhere you initialize `LDClient`:\n\n    <script src=\"/public/eventsource.js\"></script>\n\nIf you use [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) or\n[browserify](http://browserify.org/), make sure to require the polyfill before\n`LDClient` is initialized.\n\n### Document.querySelectorAll() polyfill\n\nIf you need to run A/B tests on IE7 or IE8 you will need to install a polyfill\nfor `document.querySelector()` such as\n[polyfill-queryselector](https://github.com/cobbdb/polyfill-queryselector).\n\nYou can load the polyfll via a script tag in the `<head>`:\n\n    <script src=\"/public/querySelector.js\"></script>\n\nYou can also install it with `npm install polyfill-queryselector` or `bower install polyfill-queryselector`.\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are two ways to install the client-side SDK:\n\n1. Via the `npm` package: `npm install --save ldclient-js`\n\n2. A minimized version of the script is also hosted on our CDN, and can be\n   included via a `script` tag:\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://app.launchdarkly.com/snippet/ldclient.min.js\">\n```\n\n## Basics\n\nTo create a client instance, pass your environment's client-side ID (available\non your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)) and\nuser context to the `LDClient.initialize` function:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);\n```\n\n## Feature flags\n\nThe client will emit a `ready` event when it has been initialized. Once it has\nbeen initialized, call `variation` to access your feature flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('ready', function() {\n console.log(\"It's now safe to request feature flags\");\n var showFeature = client.variation(\"YOUR_FEATURE_KEY\", false);\n\n if (showFeature) {\n   ...\n } else {\n   ...\n }\n  });\n```\n\nOut of the box, initializing the client will make a remote request to\nLaunchDarkly, so it may take approximately 100 milliseconds before the ready\nevent is emitted. If you require feature flag values before rendering the page,\nwe recommend bootstrapping the client. If the client is bootstrapped, it will\nemit the ready event immediately.\n\n_Note_: Feature flags must marked available to the client-side SDK (see your\nfeature flag's settings page) before they can be used in variation calls on the\nfront-end. If you request a feature flag that is not available, you'll receive\nthe default value for that flag.\n\nYou can also fetch all feature flags for a user:\n\n```js\nvar flags = client.allFlags();\n```\n\nThis will return a key / value map of all your feature flags. The map will\ncontain `null` values for any flags that would return the fallback value (the\nsecond argument that you normally pass to `variation`). Note that this will send\nanalytics events to LaunchDarkly as if you'd called `variation` for every\nfeature flag.\n\n### Bootstrapping\n\nBootstrapping refers to providing the LaunchDarkly client object with an\ninitial, immediately available set of feature flag values so that on page load\n`variation` can be called with no delay.\n\n#### From the server-side SDK\n\nThe preferred approach to bootstrapping is to populate the bootstrap values (a\nmap of feature flag keys to flag values) from your backend. LaunchDarkly's\nserver-side SDKs have a function called `allFlags`-- this function provides the\ninitial set of bootstrap values. You can then provide these values to your\nfront-end as a template. Depending on your templating language, this might look\nsomething like this:\n\n```js\nvar user = {key: 'user.example.com'};\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n bootstrap: {\n   {{ ldclient.all_flags(user) }}\n }\n});\n```\n\nIf you bootstrap from the server-side, feature flags will be ready immediately,\nand clients will always receive the latest feature flag values.\n\n#### From Local Storage\n\nAlternatively, you can bootstrap feature flags from local storage.\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    bootstrap: 'localStorage',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nWhen using local storage, the client will store the latest flag settings in\nlocal storage. On page load, the previous settings will be used and the 'ready'\nevent will be emitted immediately. This means that on page load, the user may\nsee cached flag values until the next page load.\n\nYou can still subscribe to flag changes if you're using local storage.\n\n### Secure mode\n\nSecure mode ensures that feature flag settings for a user are kept private, and\nthat one user cannot inspect the settings for another user. Secure mode works by\nhaving you include a server-generated HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, signed\nwith the SDK key for your environment.\n\nYou can enable secure mode for each environment on your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). You\nshould send the computed hash for your user in the `options` array during client\ninitialization:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    hash: 'SERVER_GENERATED_HASH',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nEach of our server-side SDKs includes a method to compute the secure mode hash\nfor a user. You can pass this to your front-end code in a template. For example:\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n       hash: {{ ldclient.secure_mode_hash(user) }} // this is a template directive, and the ldclient instance here is your server-side SDK client\n  });\n```\n\nTo compute the hash yourself, locate the SDK key for your environment on your\naccount settings page. Then, compute an HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, using\nyour SDK key as a secret. Here's what this would look like in Node.js:\n\n```js\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_SDK_KEY');\nhmac.update('YOUR_USER_KEY');\nhash = hmac.digest('hex');\n```\n\n### Listening to flag change events\n\nThe client uses an event emitter pattern to allow you to subscribe to feature\nflag changes in real time. To subscribe to all feature flag changes, listen for\nthe `change` event:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change', function(settings) {\n  console.log('flags changed:', settings);\n});\n```\n\nThe `settings` object will contain a map of updated feature flag keys and\nvalues. The map will only contain the keys to flags that have changed. You can\nalso subscribe to specific flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change:YOUR_FLAG_KEY', function(value, previous) {\n  console.log('YOUR_FLAG_KEY changed:', value, '(' + previous + ')');\n});\n```\n\n## Events\n\n### Click and pageview events\n\nIf you've defined\n[click or pageview goals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/running-ab-tests)\nin LaunchDarkly, they'll be sent automatically once the client has been\ninitialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click\nor pageview goals.\n\n### Custom events\n\nYou can send custom events by calling the client's `track` method. For example:\n\n```js\nclient.track('Signed up');\n```\n\n### Single page apps\n\nThe SDK automatically handles URL changes (made via the HTML5 history API or by\nchanging the URL hash fragment), and will trigger pageview and click events\ncorrectly.\n\n## Changing the user context\n\nYou may wish to change the user context dynamically and receive the new set of\nfeature flags for that user or generate events for the new user. For example, on\na sign-in page in a single-page app, you may initialize the client with an\nanonymous user. When the user logs in, you'd want the feature flag settings for\nthe authenticated user. To do this, you can call the `identify` function:\n\n```js\nclient.identify(newUser, hash, function() {\n  console.log(\"New user's flags available\");\n});\n```\n\nThe `hash` parameter is the hash for the new user, assuming that the user's key\nhas changed. It is only required in secure mode-- if secure mode is not enabled,\nyou can pass in `null` for the hash.\n\n## Development information\n\nTo build the module, first run `npm install`. Then run `npm run build`. You can\nalso run `npm run watch` to rebuild the module automatically on file change.\n\nTo run the tests, run `npm run test`.\n\n## Community\n\nHere are resources from our awesome community:\n\n* [TrueCar/react-launch-darkly](https://github.com/TrueCar/react-launch-darkly/): A set of component helpers to add support for LaunchDarkly to your React.js app\n* [yusinto/ld-redux](https://github.com/yusinto/ld-redux/): A library to integrate LaunchDarkly with React and Redux\n* [tdeekens/flopflip](https://github.com/tdeekens/flopflip): A flexible feature-toggling library that integrates with LaunchDarkly\n\n## About LaunchDarkly\n\n* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard. With LaunchDarkly, you can:\n  * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.\n  * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).\n  * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.\n  * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the gold plan get access to more features than users in the silver plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.\n* LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for\n  *

LaunchDarkly SDK for Client-Side JavaScript\n\n[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/next.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/next)\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis is the official LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK. This SDK does two\nthings:\n\n* Makes feature flags available to your client-side (front-end) JavaScript code.\n* Sends click, pageview, and custom events from your front-end for A/B tests and\n  analytics.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThe LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK supports the following browsers:\n\n* Chrome (any recent)\n* Firefox (any recent)\n* Safari (any recent)\\*\n* Internet Explorer (IE10+)\\*\n* Edge (any recent)\\*\n* Opera (any recent)\\*\n\n\\* These browsers do not support streaming new flags to connected clients, even\nwhen `client.on('change')` is called.\n\n### EventSource polyfill\n\nIf you need streaming support, and you wish to support browsers that do not\nsupport `EventSource` natively, you can install a polyfill, such as\n[EventSource](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource).\n\nYou can load the polyfill via a script tag in the `<head>` before the script\nwhere you initialize `LDClient`:\n\n    <script src=\"/public/eventsource.js\"></script>\n\nIf you use [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) or\n[browserify](http://browserify.org/), make sure to require the polyfill before\n`LDClient` is initialized.\n\n### Document.querySelectorAll() polyfill\n\nIf you need to run A/B tests on IE7 or IE8 you will need to install a polyfill\nfor `document.querySelector()` such as\n[polyfill-queryselector](https://github.com/cobbdb/polyfill-queryselector).\n\nYou can load the polyfll via a script tag in the `<head>`:\n\n    <script src=\"/public/querySelector.js\"></script>\n\nYou can also install it with `npm install polyfill-queryselector` or `bower install polyfill-queryselector`.\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are two ways to install the client-side SDK:\n\n1.  Via the `npm` package: `npm install --save ldclient-js`\n\n2.  A minimized version of the script is also hosted on our CDN, and can be\n    included via a `script` tag:\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://app.launchdarkly.com/snippet/ldclient.min.js\">\n```\n\n## Basics\n\nTo create a client instance, pass your environment's client-side ID (available\non your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects)) and\nuser context to the `LDClient.initialize` function:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user);\n```\n\n## Feature flags\n\nThe client will emit a `ready` event when it has been initialized. Once it has\nbeen initialized, call `variation` to access your feature flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('ready', function() {\n console.log(\"It's now safe to request feature flags\");\n var showFeature = client.variation(\"YOUR_FEATURE_KEY\", false);\n\n if (showFeature) {\n   ...\n } else {\n   ...\n }\n  });\n```\n\nOut of the box, initializing the client will make a remote request to\nLaunchDarkly, so it may take approximately 100 milliseconds before the ready\nevent is emitted. If you require feature flag values before rendering the page,\nwe recommend bootstrapping the client. If the client is bootstrapped, it will\nemit the ready event immediately.\n\n_Note_: Feature flags must marked available to the client-side SDK (see your\nfeature flag's settings page) before they can be used in variation calls on the\nfront-end. If you request a feature flag that is not available, you'll receive\nthe default value for that flag.\n\nYou can also fetch all feature flags for a user:\n\n```js\nvar flags = client.allFlags();\n```\n\nThis will return a key / value map of all your feature flags. The map will\ncontain `null` values for any flags that would return the fallback value (the\nsecond argument that you normally pass to `variation`). Note that this will send\nanalytics events to LaunchDarkly as if you'd called `variation` for every\nfeature flag.\n\n### Bootstrapping\n\nBootstrapping refers to providing the LaunchDarkly client object with an\ninitial, immediately available set of feature flag values so that on page load\n`variation` can be called with no delay.\n\n#### From the server-side SDK\n\nThe preferred approach to bootstrapping is to populate the bootstrap values (a\nmap of feature flag keys to flag values) from your backend. LaunchDarkly's\nserver-side SDKs have a function called `allFlags`-- this function provides the\ninitial set of bootstrap values. You can then provide these values to your\nfront-end as a template. Depending on your templating language, this might look\nsomething like this:\n\n```js\nvar user = {key: 'user.example.com'};\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n bootstrap: {\n   {{ ldclient.all_flags(user) }}\n }\n});\n```\n\nIf you bootstrap from the server-side, feature flags will be ready immediately,\nand clients will always receive the latest feature flag values.\n\n#### From Local Storage\n\nAlternatively, you can bootstrap feature flags from local storage.\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    bootstrap: 'localStorage',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nWhen using local storage, the client will store the latest flag settings in\nlocal storage. On page load, the previous settings will be used and the 'ready'\nevent will be emitted immediately. This means that on page load, the user may\nsee cached flag values until the next page load.\n\nYou can still subscribe to flag changes if you're using local storage.\n\n### Secure mode\n\nSecure mode ensures that feature flag settings for a user are kept private, and\nthat one user cannot inspect the settings for another user. Secure mode works by\nhaving you include a server-generated HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, signed\nwith the SDK key for your environment.\n\nYou can enable secure mode for each environment on your\n[account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). You\nshould send the computed hash for your user in the `options` array during client\ninitialization:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    hash: 'SERVER_GENERATED_HASH',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nEach of our server-side SDKs includes a method to compute the secure mode hash\nfor a user. You can pass this to your front-end code in a template. For example:\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n       hash: {{ ldclient.secure_mode_hash(user) }} // this is a template directive, and the ldclient instance here is your server-side SDK client\n  });\n```\n\nTo compute the hash yourself, locate the SDK key for your environment on your\naccount settings page. Then, compute an HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, using\nyour SDK key as a secret. Here's what this would look like in Node.js:\n\n```js\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_SDK_KEY');\nhmac.update('YOUR_USER_KEY');\nhash = hmac.digest('hex');\n```\n\n### Listening to flag change events\n\nThe client uses an event emitter pattern to allow you to subscribe to feature\nflag changes in real time. To subscribe to all feature flag changes, listen for\nthe `change` event:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change', function(settings) {\n  console.log('flags changed:', settings);\n});\n```\n\nThe `settings` object will contain a map of updated feature flag keys and\nvalues. The map will only contain the keys to flags that have changed. You can\nalso subscribe to specific flags:\n\n```js\nclient.on('change:YOUR_FLAG_KEY', function(value, previous) {\n  console.log('YOUR_FLAG_KEY changed:', value, '(' + previous + ')');\n});\n```\n\n## Events\n\n### Click and pageview events\n\nIf you've defined\n[click or pageview goals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/running-ab-tests)\nin LaunchDarkly, they'll be sent automatically once the client has been\ninitialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click\nor pageview goals.\n\n### Custom events\n\nYou can send custom events by calling the client's `track` method. For example:\n\n```js\nclient.track('Signed up');\n```\n\n### Single page apps\n\nThe SDK automatically handles URL changes (made via the HTML5 history API or by\nchanging the URL hash fragment), and will trigger pageview and click events\ncorrectly.\n\n## Changing the user context\n\nYou may wish to change the user context dynamically and receive the new set of\nfeature flags for that user or generate events for the new user. For example, on\na sign-in page in a single-page app, you may initialize the client with an\nanonymous user. When the user logs in, you'd want the feature flag settings for\nthe authenticated user. To do this, you can call the `identify` function:\n\n```js\nclient.identify(newUser, hash, function() {\n  console.log(\"New user's flags available\");\n});\n```\n\nThe `hash` parameter is the hash for the new user, assuming that the user's key\nhas changed. It is only required in secure mode-- if secure mode is not enabled,\nyou can pass in `null` for the hash.\n\n## Development information\n\nTo build the module, first run `npm install`. Then run `npm run build`. You can\nalso run `npm run watch` to rebuild the module automatically on file change.\n\nTo run the tests, run `npm run test`.\n\n## Community\n\nHere are resources from our awesome community:\n\n* [TrueCar/react-launch-darkly](https://github.com/TrueCar/react-launch-darkly/): A set of component helpers to add support for LaunchDarkly to your React.js app\n* [yusinto/ld-redux](https://github.com/yusinto/ld-redux/): A library to integrate LaunchDarkly with React and Redux\n* [tdeekens/flopflip](https://github.com/tdeekens/flopflip): A flexible feature-toggling library that integrates with LaunchDarkly\n\n## About LaunchDarkly\n\n* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard. With LaunchDarkly, you can:\n  * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.\n  * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).\n  * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.\n  * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the gold plan get access to more features than users in the silver plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.\n* LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for\n  *

LaunchDarkly Javascript SDK for Browsers\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document describes how to set up the LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK to be used on a web page. Please see the [main readme](../../README.md) for a more general description of the client-side SDKs.\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\nThe SDK supports the following browsers:\n\n* Chrome (any recent)\n* Firefox (any recent)\n* Safari (any recent)\n* Internet Explorer (IE10+)\\*\n* Edge (any recent)\\*\n* Opera (any recent)\\*\n\n\\* These browsers do not support streaming new flags to connected clients, even when `client.on('change')` is called.\n\n## Installation\n\nIt can be installed in two ways:\n\n1. Via the `npm` package: `npm install --save ldclient-js`\n\n2. A minimized version of the script is also hosted on our CDN, and can be included via a `script` tag:\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://app.launchdarkly.com/snippet/ldclient.min.js\">\n```\n\n## Browser feature support\n\nWeb browsers vary widely in their support of specific features and standards. Three features that are used by the LaunchDarkly SDK that may not be available on every browser are `EventSource`, `document.querySelectorAll()`, and `Promise`. See below for more about how to ensure that these will work.\n\n### EventSource\n\nThe SDK uses [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) to provide a live streaming connection to LaunchDarkly, if you have enabled streaming (by using the `streaming` property or the `setStreaming` method, or by subscribing to `change` events). If you never enable streaming, `EventSource` is not used.\n\nIt is widely available in browsers, [except for Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge](https://caniuse.com/#search=EventSource). If you wish to support these, and you need streaming support, you can install a polyfill such as [event-source-polyfill](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource).\n\n#### CDN\n\nYou can load the polyfill via a script tag in the `<head>` before the script where you initialize `LDClient`:\n\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/event-source-polyfill@0.0.12/src/eventsource.min.js\"></script>\n\n#### NPM or Yarn\n\n    npm install event-source-polyfill@0.0.12\n\nThen import it before the module that initializes the LaunchDarkly client:\n\n    require('event-source-polyfill');\n\n### Document.querySelectorAll() polyfill\n\nThe SDK uses `querySelectorAll` to support click events for A/B testing.\n\nIt is widely available in browser, [except in old versions of Internet Explorer](https://caniuse.com/#feat=queryselector). If you wish to support these, and you need A/B testing support, you can install a polyfill such as [polyfill-queryselector](https://github.com/cobbdb/polyfill-queryselector).\n\n#### CDN\n\nYou can load the polyfill via a script tag in the `<head>` before the script where you initialize `LDClient`:\n\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/polyfill-queryselector@1.0.2/querySelector.js\"></script>\n\n#### NPM or Yarn\n\n    npm install polyfill-queryselector@1.0.2\n\nThen import it before the module that initializes the LaunchDarkly client:\n\n    require('polyfill-queryselector');\n\n### Promise polyfill\n\nThe SDK relies heavily on JavaScript `Promise`s. [Browsers that do not support `Promise`](https://caniuse.com/#search=Promise) include Internet Explorer and older versions of Microsoft Edge. If you need to support these, you will need to install a polyfill for `Promise`, such as [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise).\n\n#### CDN\n\nYou can load the polyfill via a script tag in the `<head>` before the script where you initialize `LDClient`:\n\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/es6-promise@4.2.4/dist/es6-promise.auto.min.js\"></script>\n\n#### NPM or Yarn\n\n    npm install es6-promise@4.2.4\n\nThen import it before the module that initializes the LaunchDarkly client:\n\n    require('es6-promise/auto');\n\n## Functionality specific to the browser SDK\n\nThis section describes features that only work in a browser context, as opposed to general features like flag evaluation that are described in the [main readme](../../README.md).\n\n### Bootstrapping from the server side\n\nThe [bootstrapping](../../README.md#Bootstrapping) mechanism lets you provide initial feature flag values at startup time. In a web application, a common approach is for your back-end application code to obtain flag values from its own server-side SDK and then pass them to the front end.\n\nLaunchDarkly's server-side SDKs have a function called `allFlagsState`, which returns a snapshot of the feature flags for a particular user. This data structure can be passed directly to the `bootstrap` property of the front-end client; you will also want to pass the user properties. Here's an example of how this might be done if you are using Node.js, Express, and Mustache templates on the back end.\n\n```js\n// in the back-end code:\napp.get('/page', function(req, res) {\n  var user = { key: 'example-user' };\n  client.allFlagsState(user, function(flagsData) {\n    templateVars = {\n      user: user,\n      allFlags: flagsData\n    };\n    res.render('myPage', templateVars);\n  });\n});\n\n// in a script within the page template:\nvar user = {{ user }};\nvar clientOptions = {\n  bootstrap: {{ allFlags }}\n};\nvar client = ldclient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, clientOptions);\n```\n\n### Secure mode\n\nSecure mode ensures that feature flag settings for a user are kept private, and that one user cannot inspect the settings for another user. Secure mode works by having you include a server-generated HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, signed with the SDK key for your environment.\n\nYou can enable secure mode for each environment on your [account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). You should send the computed hash for your user in the `options` array during client initialization:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    hash: 'SERVER_GENERATED_HASH',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nEach of our server-side SDKs includes a method to compute the secure mode hash for a user. You can pass this to your front-end code in a template. For example:\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n       hash: {{ ldclient.secure_mode_hash(user) }} // this is a template directive, and the ldclient instance here is your server-side SDK client\n  });\n```\n\nTo compute the hash yourself, locate the SDK key for your environment on your account settings page. Then, compute an HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, using your SDK key as a secret. Here's what this would look like in Node.js:\n\n```js\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_SDK_KEY');\nhmac.update('YOUR_USER_KEY');\nhash = hmac.digest('hex');\n```\n\nIf you change the user context dynamically with `identify()`, you can provide a new secure mode hash at the same time:\n\n```js\nclient.identify(newUser, hash, function() {\n  console.log(\"New user's flags available\");\n});\n```\n\n### Click and pageview events\n\nIf you've defined [click or pageview goals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/running-ab-tests) in LaunchDarkly, they'll be sent automatically once the client has been initialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click or pageview goals.\n\n### Single page apps\n\nThe SDK automatically handles URL changes (made via the HTML5 history API or by changing the URL hash fragment), and will trigger pageview and click events correctly.\n\n### Custom events\n\nCustom events sent with the `track` method are treated slightly differently by the browser SDK: the client normally expects that the event key you pass to `track` corresponds to one of your custom goals. You can still send custom events whose keys do not correspond to a goal, but the client will log a warning if you do.\n\n### Do Not Track\n\nIn browsers that have a \"do not track\" option, the LaunchDarkly SDK will not attempt to send any analytics events if this option is set.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client#readme","_id":"ldclient-js@2.9.0-alpha.1","_npmVersion":"6.3.0","_nodeVersion":"8.11.3","_npmUser":{"name":"launchdarkly","email":"dev@launchdarkly.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-9vBLYjb1Yw5Vea8apwhnqQyKC1MmQXSvybWSJxMWOiqtgvLJfgQbo0Z5dluaTuJN8Cgy5J/h5PCXVbpvElij2A==","shasum":"f4fb804bdcabb2164e89232fced712ab3ff65212","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/ldclient-js/-/ldclient-js-2.9.0-alpha.1.tgz","fileCount":10,"unpackedSize":298208,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n\r\nwsFcBAEBCAAQBQJcBdofCRA9TVsSAnZWagAAKGQP/RvJHXd2hFxhcjMGAA2X\nfMPVF2x4lhJug7ZstifGbYk5YR1zWB+AKm/D+OUsU+8UeBP1gzOwInqxSTQR\n0qaTaJPik8g05DT1RuvNEpOFWDzEXIGQwZJUv/nQRUFJQrur1C1Mr5bbGAkM\nBNPe2NsX+1RSzMMoz7bt9vZ7hjim4f+wyGtlOrqzaNmODllX7UG78jeSMPu2\n9eXh7Z/Fkcflfw7D3HGKoAzwvQlXtnbt7tZcB6rDbsN6QQo8v6oTSEbMKTJY\n39bRqswyvLUmPL+aDh6PWiUo7K1ISWPIP7EsWTFBAP6CvuLxWb4yz3I/C/v5\n2hR32fS17rjNaDcGN3RviTQlBqUYH9owTpE1CjDXCKM9CZfYliVh0ca5AXZH\n2xAIpewBw6JY7h6Uy6r4nu3sfT1i2a4Fckms3trfstxiY6q2fcMyVBfwdoq0\noezV4/yNtK4qz1oqVOvrDqS/C43qKvrdlwP2+b3bUteuYEfP/lSYhpqjWQWb\nyfOxi6zF1JI/j1e9Q11Zqr8ADlb1DxR9Ho8T5zkOEGuNaGyiF5ATAhqWsN5R\nnaOH3tVEfykZcz28/US75YhXIXjK++Q8HkOA3RJGXGYXkYr50lNCY7lzUG14\nG+LjDbFo26r0q9XJ80yXP00mC0/qU5n6r6BUsingjg5OdRK2hqvEuWTy0WUr\nQc6q\r\n=O37E\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","signatures":[{"keyid":"SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA","sig":"MEUCIQC7/0yIWbxjyDQNby7XZCzs8+I0xgD8W7ZJqBBRSoDGowIgDE6dP5jPfDYUTcXNV/xRf0Rxr0J0negtrr1R18TzeiY="}]},"maintainers":[{"email":"alexis.georges@gmail.com","name":"apucacao"},{"email":"john@launchdarkly.com","name":"jkodumal"},{"email":"dev@launchdarkly.com","name":"launchdarkly"},{"email":"maleko@launchdarkly.com","name":"maleko"},{"email":"pkaeding@launchdarkly.com","name":"pkaeding"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/ldclient-js_2.9.0-alpha.1_1543887390393_0.4549831431056368"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"2.9.0-alpha.2":{"name":"ldclient-js","version":"2.9.0-alpha.2","description":"LaunchDarkly SDK for JavaScript","author":{"name":"LaunchDarkly","email":"team@launchdarkly.com"},"license":"Apache-2.0","keywords":["launchdarkly","analytics","client"],"types":"./typings.d.ts","main":"dist/ldclient.cjs.js","module":"dist/ldclient.es.js","scripts":{"lint":"eslint --format 'node_modules/eslint-formatter-pretty' --ignore-path ../../.eslintignore","lint:all":"eslint --format 'node_modules/eslint-formatter-pretty' --ignore-path ../../.eslintignore src","format":"npm run format:md && npm run format:js","format:md":"prettier --parser markdown --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore --write '*.md'","format:js":"prettier --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore --write 'src/**/*.js'","format:test":"npm run format:test:md && npm run format:test:js","format:test:md":"prettier --parser markdown --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore --list-different '*.md'","format:test:js":"prettier --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore --list-different 'src/**/*.js'","build":"cross-env NODE_ENV=development rollup -c rollup.config.js","build:min":"cross-env NODE_ENV=production rollup -c rollup.config.js","test":"NODE_ENV=test jest","test:junit":"NODE_ENV=test jest --testResultsProcessor jest-junit","check-typescript":"node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc","clean":"rimraf dist/**","prepublishOnly":"npm run build:min"},"devDependencies":{"babel-core":"6.26.0","babel-eslint":"8.2.2","babel-jest":"22.4.3","babel-polyfill":"6.26.0","chai":"4.1.2","cross-env":"5.1.4","eslint":"4.19.1","eslint-config-prettier":"2.9.0","eslint-config-xo":"0.20.1","eslint-formatter-pretty":"1.3.0","eslint-plugin-babel":"5.0.0","eslint-plugin-prettier":"2.6.0","jest":"22.4.3","jest-junit":"3.6.0","jest-localstorage-mock":"2.2.0","jsdom":"11.11.0","prettier":"1.11.1","readline-sync":"1.4.9","rimraf":"2.6.2","rollup":"0.57.1","semver":"5.5.0","semver-compare":"1.0.0","sinon":"4.5.0","typescript":"3.0.1"},"dependencies":{"escape-string-regexp":"1.0.5","ldclient-js-common":"^2.9.0-alpha.2"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client.git"},"readme":"# LaunchDarkly Javascript SDK for Browsers\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document describes how to set up the LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK to be used on a web page.

You can still send custom events whose keys do not correspond to a goal, but the client will log a warning if you do.\n\n### Do Not Track\n\nIn browsers that have a \"do not track\" option, the LaunchDarkly SDK will not attempt to send any analytics events if this option is set.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client#readme","_id":"ldclient-js@2.9.0-alpha.2","_npmVersion":"6.3.0","_nodeVersion":"8.11.3","_npmUser":{"name":"launchdarkly","email":"dev@launchdarkly.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-NWpzXDZWmS22uvmXiQ93NSqcbwVIeE71PIO30hAknRteMYw3AYAEaqhr9MjE+FxKC52K68SO+LbZ1nYHfxgaPw==","shasum":"9fd8a08eb762b7a236f7a112f41aae689f3d2036","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/ldclient-js/-/ldclient-js-2.9.0-alpha.2.tgz","fileCount":10,"unpackedSize":298208,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\nVersion: OpenPGP.js v3.0.4\r\nComment: https://openpgpjs.org\r\n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\n4TeL\r\n=tyQB\r\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\r\n","signatures":[{"keyid":"SHA256:jl3bwswu80PjjokCgh0o2w5c2U4LhQAE57gj9cz1kzA","sig":"MEUCIQCJv8t91AySh3PJa7OJQibi5IcFEvXA40MGmDQe2C6uzQIgS2nHVYpIooE0sb54CQBQ4x8bDy2CpBy0CYnenb36CJc="}]},"maintainers":[{"email":"alexis.georges@gmail.com","name":"apucacao"},{"email":"john@launchdarkly.com","name":"jkodumal"},{"email":"dev@launchdarkly.com","name":"launchdarkly"},{"email":"maleko@launchdarkly.com","name":"maleko"},{"email":"pkaeding@launchdarkly.com","name":"pkaeding"}],"directories":{},"_npmOperationalInternal":{"host":"s3://npm-registry-packages","tmp":"tmp/ldclient-js_2.9.0-alpha.2_1544041754424_0.8763406186631844"},"_hasShrinkwrap":false},"2.9.0-beta.1":{"name":"ldclient-js","version":"2.9.0-beta.1","description":"LaunchDarkly SDK for JavaScript","author":{"name":"LaunchDarkly","email":"team@launchdarkly.com"},"license":"Apache-2.0","keywords":["launchdarkly","analytics","client"],"types":"./typings.d.ts","main":"dist/ldclient.cjs.js","module":"dist/ldclient.es.js","scripts":{"lint":"eslint --format 'node_modules/eslint-formatter-pretty' --ignore-path ../../.eslintignore","lint:all":"eslint --format 'node_modules/eslint-formatter-pretty' --ignore-path ../../.eslintignore src","format":"npm run format:md && npm run format:js","format:md":"prettier --parser markdown --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore --write '*.md'","format:js":"prettier --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore --write 'src/**/*.js'","format:test":"npm run format:test:md && npm run format:test:js","format:test:md":"prettier --parser markdown --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore --list-different '*.md'","format:test:js":"prettier --ignore-path ../../.prettierignore --list-different 'src/**/*.js'","build":"cross-env NODE_ENV=development rollup -c rollup.config.js","build:min":"cross-env NODE_ENV=production rollup -c rollup.config.js","test":"NODE_ENV=test jest","test:junit":"NODE_ENV=test jest --testResultsProcessor jest-junit","check-typescript":"node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc","clean":"rimraf dist/**","prepublishOnly":"npm run build:min"},"devDependencies":{"babel-core":"6.26.0","babel-eslint":"8.2.2","babel-jest":"22.4.3","babel-polyfill":"6.26.0","chai":"4.1.2","cross-env":"5.1.4","eslint":"4.19.1","eslint-config-prettier":"2.9.0","eslint-config-xo":"0.20.1","eslint-formatter-pretty":"1.3.0","eslint-plugin-babel":"5.0.0","eslint-plugin-prettier":"2.6.0","jest":"22.4.3","jest-junit":"3.6.0","jest-localstorage-mock":"2.2.0","jsdom":"11.11.0","prettier":"1.11.1","readline-sync":"1.4.9","rimraf":"2.6.2","rollup":"0.57.1","semver":"5.5.0","semver-compare":"1.0.0","sinon":"4.5.0","typescript":"3.0.1"},"dependencies":{"escape-string-regexp":"1.0.5","ldclient-js-common":"^2.9.0-beta.1"},"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client.git"},"readme":"# LaunchDarkly JavaScript SDK for Browsers\n\n# This is a beta release\n\nThis version of the client-side SDKs includes the initial beta version of the Electron SDK, and also includes changes to the JavaScript SDK for browsers. The beta version should not be used in production environments. The source code for this version is on the [\"`electron`\" branch](https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client/tree/electron) of the public repository.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document describes how to set up the LaunchDarkly client-side JavaScript SDK to be used on a web page. Please see the [main readme](../../README.md) for a more general description of the client-side SDKs.\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\nThe SDK supports the following browsers:\n\n* Chrome (any recent)\n* Firefox (any recent)\n* Safari (any recent)\n* Internet Explorer (IE10+)\\*\n* Edge (any recent)\\*\n* Opera (any recent)\\*\n\n\\* These browsers do not support streaming new flags to connected clients, even when `client.on('change')` is called.\n\n## Installation\n\nIt can be installed in two ways:\n\n1. Via the `npm` package: `npm install --save ldclient-js`\n\n2. A minimized version of the script is also hosted on our CDN, and can be included via a `script` tag:\n\n```\n<script src=\"https://app.launchdarkly.com/snippet/ldclient.min.js\">\n```\n\n## Browser feature support\n\nWeb browsers vary widely in their support of specific features and standards. Three features that are used by the LaunchDarkly SDK that may not be available on every browser are `EventSource`, `document.querySelectorAll()`, and `Promise`. See below for more about how to ensure that these will work.\n\n### EventSource\n\nThe SDK uses [`EventSource`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) to provide a live streaming connection to LaunchDarkly, if you have enabled streaming (by using the `streaming` property or the `setStreaming` method, or by subscribing to `change` events). If you never enable streaming, `EventSource` is not used.\n\nIt is widely available in browsers, [except for Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge](https://caniuse.com/#search=EventSource). If you wish to support these, and you need streaming support, you can install a polyfill such as [event-source-polyfill](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource).\n\n#### CDN\n\nYou can load the polyfill via a script tag in the `<head>` before the script where you initialize `LDClient`:\n\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/event-source-polyfill@0.0.12/src/eventsource.min.js\"></script>\n\n#### NPM or Yarn\n\n    npm install event-source-polyfill@0.0.12\n\nThen import it before the module that initializes the LaunchDarkly client:\n\n    require('event-source-polyfill');\n\n### Document.querySelectorAll() polyfill\n\nThe SDK uses `querySelectorAll` to support click events for A/B testing.\n\nIt is widely available in browser, [except in old versions of Internet Explorer](https://caniuse.com/#feat=queryselector). If you wish to support these, and you need A/B testing support, you can install a polyfill such as [polyfill-queryselector](https://github.com/cobbdb/polyfill-queryselector).\n\n#### CDN\n\nYou can load the polyfill via a script tag in the `<head>` before the script where you initialize `LDClient`:\n\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/polyfill-queryselector@1.0.2/querySelector.js\"></script>\n\n#### NPM or Yarn\n\n    npm install polyfill-queryselector@1.0.2\n\nThen import it before the module that initializes the LaunchDarkly client:\n\n    require('polyfill-queryselector');\n\n### Promise polyfill\n\nThe SDK relies heavily on JavaScript `Promise`s. [Browsers that do not support `Promise`](https://caniuse.com/#search=Promise) include Internet Explorer and older versions of Microsoft Edge. If you need to support these, you will need to install a polyfill for `Promise`, such as [es6-promise](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise).\n\n#### CDN\n\nYou can load the polyfill via a script tag in the `<head>` before the script where you initialize `LDClient`:\n\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/es6-promise@4.2.4/dist/es6-promise.auto.min.js\"></script>\n\n#### NPM or Yarn\n\n    npm install es6-promise@4.2.4\n\nThen import it before the module that initializes the LaunchDarkly client:\n\n    require('es6-promise/auto');\n\n## Functionality specific to the browser SDK\n\nThis section describes features that only work in a browser context, as opposed to general features like flag evaluation that are described in the [main readme](../../README.md).\n\n### Bootstrapping from the server side\n\nThe [bootstrapping](../../README.md#Bootstrapping) mechanism lets you provide initial feature flag values at startup time. In a web application, a common approach is for your back-end application code to obtain flag values from its own server-side SDK and then pass them to the front end.\n\nLaunchDarkly's server-side SDKs have a function called `allFlagsState`, which returns a snapshot of the feature flags for a particular user. This data structure can be passed directly to the `bootstrap` property of the front-end client; you will also want to pass the user properties. Here's an example of how this might be done if you are using Node.js, Express, and Mustache templates on the back end.\n\n```js\n// in the back-end code:\napp.get('/page', function(req, res) {\n  var user = { key: 'example-user' };\n  client.allFlagsState(user, function(flagsData) {\n    templateVars = {\n      user: user,\n      allFlags: flagsData\n    };\n    res.render('myPage', templateVars);\n  });\n});\n\n// in a script within the page template:\nvar user = {{ user }};\nvar clientOptions = {\n  bootstrap: {{ allFlags }}\n};\nvar client = ldclient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, clientOptions);\n```\n\n### Secure mode\n\nSecure mode ensures that feature flag settings for a user are kept private, and that one user cannot inspect the settings for another user. Secure mode works by having you include a server-generated HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, signed with the SDK key for your environment.\n\nYou can enable secure mode for each environment on your [account settings page](https://app.launchdarkly.com/settings#/projects). You should send the computed hash for your user in the `options` array during client initialization:\n\n```js\nvar user = { key: 'user.example.com' };\nvar client = LDClient.initialize(\n  'YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID',\n  user,\n  (options = {\n    hash: 'SERVER_GENERATED_HASH',\n  })\n);\n```\n\nEach of our server-side SDKs includes a method to compute the secure mode hash for a user. You can pass this to your front-end code in a template. For example:\n\n```js\nvar client = LDClient.initialize('YOUR_CLIENT_SIDE_ID', user, options = {\n       hash: {{ ldclient.secure_mode_hash(user) }} // this is a template directive, and the ldclient instance here is your server-side SDK client\n  });\n```\n\nTo compute the hash yourself, locate the SDK key for your environment on your account settings page. Then, compute an HMAC SHA256 hash of your user key, using your SDK key as a secret. Here's what this would look like in Node.js:\n\n```js\nvar crypto = require('crypto');\nvar hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'YOUR_SDK_KEY');\nhmac.update('YOUR_USER_KEY');\nhash = hmac.digest('hex');\n```\n\nIf you change the user context dynamically with `identify()`, you can provide a new secure mode hash at the same time:\n\n```js\nclient.identify(newUser, hash, function() {\n  console.log(\"New user's flags available\");\n});\n```\n\n### Click and pageview events\n\nIf you've defined [click or pageview goals](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/running-ab-tests) in LaunchDarkly, they'll be sent automatically once the client has been initialized. You do not have to do anything else with the client to send click or pageview goals.\n\n### Single page apps\n\nThe SDK automatically handles URL changes (made via the HTML5 history API or by changing the URL hash fragment), and will trigger pageview and click events correctly.\n\n### Custom events\n\nCustom events sent with the `track` method are treated slightly differently by the browser SDK: the client normally expects that the event key you pass to `track` corresponds to one of your custom goals. You can still send custom events whose keys do not correspond to a goal, but the client will log a warning if you do.\n\n### Do Not Track\n\nIn browsers that have a \"do not track\" option, the LaunchDarkly SDK will not attempt to send any analytics events if this option is set.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/launchdarkly/js-client#readme","_id":"ldclient-js@2.9.0-beta.1","_npmVersion":"6.3.0","_nodeVersion":"8.11.3","_npmUser":{"name":"launchdarkly","email":"dev@launchdarkly.com"},"dist":{"integrity":"sha512-t440qvk+M/7ccQ7jq6zc9nNYFvl1tAmo+AadiWg53hcFtrDoZ418em1Xaf+2smwB3AQFqNs2Y4asNbW4DXMdoA==","shasum":"82bbfdb6548336cc175d8fae1843b269e134fba7","tarball":"https://registry.npmjs.org/ldclient-js/-/ldclient-js-2.9.0-beta.1.tgz","fileCount":10,"unpackedSize":310027,"npm-signature":"-----BEGIN
